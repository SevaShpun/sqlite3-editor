This is a SQLite client based on the [better-sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sqlite3) package. We use this implementation only for debugging, and not for the VSCode extension, as VSCode updates the version of Node.js it ships with with each update, and both the [sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3) and [better-sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sqlite3) packages require rebuilding (or running `npm install`) for each Node.js version, which is not possible as a VSCode extension.
Besides that, I may use this implementation for a Electron version in the future.
